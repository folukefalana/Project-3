# Project-3

### Project Overview

The ["Titanic Survival Analytics"](https://1drv.ms/u/c/53d9d0eaf14ddcbb/EZJ-NVL0ritDs2GiIG0h5TkB2B6fzr2lLYdZMckX6hzrkg?e=I3pc2B) Power BI project was created to offer a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. This project involved sourcing historical data and transforming it into meaningful insights through a series of interactive dashboards and visualizations.
The analysis focused on key aspects such as passenger demographics (age, gender, and family size), travel class, port of embarkation, and survival status. By exploring these variables, the dashboard enables users to uncover patterns and correlations that shed light on who was more likely to survive and why.

### Data Sources:

- Titanic Passenger Data: Detailed information about each passenger, including demographics, class, port of embarkation, and survival status.
Key Metrics and KPIs:

- Total Passengers by Class: Visual representation of the distribution of passengers across different classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
Total Passengers by Port of Embarkation: Bar chart or pie chart illustrating the number of passengers embarking from each port.
Total Passengers by Sex: Pie chart or bar chart showing the gender distribution of passengers.
Total Passengers: Real-time display of the overall count of passengers.
Survivor Analysis:

- Survivors by Class: Visual representation of the number of survivors in each passenger class.
Survivors by Port of Embarkation: Bar chart illustrating the distribution of survivors based on the port of embarkation.
Survivors by Sex: Pie chart or bar chart showcasing the gender distribution among survivors.
Non-Survivor Analysis:

- Non-Survivors by Class: Visual representation of the number of non-survivors in each passenger class.
Non-Survivors by Port of Embarkation: Bar chart illustrating the distribution of non-survivors based on the port of embarkation.
Non-Survivors by Sex: Pie chart or bar chart showcasing the gender distribution among non-survivors.
Dashboard and Visualizations:

- Passenger Demographics Overview: Visual display of total passengers, survivors, and non-survivors by class, port of embarkation, and sex.

- Survival Rate Metrics: Cards or KPI indicators summarizing key survival rate metrics.

- Interactive Reports: Reports that allowed users to interact with the data, filter information based on specific criteria, and drill down into detailed insights.

- Data Security: Implementation of role-based access controls to ensure that sensitive passenger information was only accessible to authorized personnel.

The "Titanic Survival Analytics" Power BI project served as a valuable tool for historians, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore and understand patterns of survival among Titanic passengers based on various demographic factors. It provided insights into the distribution of passengers, survival rates, and allowed stakeholders to draw meaningful conclusions from the historical data.
